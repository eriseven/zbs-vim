# zbs-vim

zbs-vim adds a useful subset of Vim editing to ZeroBrane Studio and the ability to open a currently edited file in an instance Vim

When using this to open a real instance of Vim, it's useful to set the following lines in your vimrc file so that it opens in the same position each time:

    set lines=65 columns=140
    winpos 400 0
